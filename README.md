## Description

This banking app is designed to provide users with a secure and user-friendly interface for their banking needs. It consists of two main pages: the login screen (index.html) and the user dashboard (dashboard.html). The project is organized into JavaScript (js) and Cascading Style Sheets (css) folders for code modularity and maintainability.

## Key Features

- **Login Screen (index.html):**
  - Users can enter their credentials to access their accounts.
  - The `login.js` script handles the login logic, including authentication and error handling.

- **User Dashboard (dashboard.html):**
  - After successful login, users are directed to the dashboard where they can manage their accounts and perform various banking activities.
  - The `dashboard.js` script provides the necessary functionality for the dashboard.

- **Styling:**
  - General styling is maintained in `style.css` to ensure a consistent look and feel across the application.
  - Dashboard-specific styling is applied through `dashboard.css` to enhance the user experience on the dashboard page.
